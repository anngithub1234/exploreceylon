        <p>The Sacred Relic also called as Sri Dalada Mligawa by locals ia Buddhist temple in the city of kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex of the Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of Buddha. The main entrance gate which lies over the moat is called Mahawahalkada. At the foot of Mahawahalkada steps there is a Sandakada pahana (moonstone) which is carved in Kandyan architectural style. Elephants are depicted in stone the either sides of the entrance. A makara Torana and two gurdian stones are placed on top of the staircase. The Temple of Tooth was built by Vira Narendra Sinha. The octangonal Patthirippuwa and moat was added during the reign of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. Kandy was last capital of the Sinhalese kings and is a UNESCO (1988) world heritage site due to the temple. Many pilgrims from all over the world converge here every day of the year, but especially during the Esala Perahara season which is in month of July. </p>

            <img src="images/perahara.webp" style="width: 100%;">
            <p>Esala Perahera, one  of must watch Sri Lanka's oldest and largest Buddhist celebrations. This historic event is held every year to honor Lord Buddha's sacred tooth relic, which is kept at Temole of Tooth Relic. Processions take to the streets at night for ten days during July or August. Perahera is a Sinhalese word that roughly translates as "parade of musicians, dancers, drummers, and other entertainers." As a result, well-dressed elephants and tuskers stroll along the routes with the tooth relic in a casket as part of the procession. The celebration comes to a close with a water cutting ritual in Kandy's Mahaweli River.</p>
